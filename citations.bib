	abstract = {The obscuring circumnuclear torus of dusty molecular gas is one of the major components of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The torus can be studied by analyzing the time response of its infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in the AGN continuum luminosity, a technique known as reverberation mapping. The IR response is the convolution of the AGN ultraviolet/optical light curve with a transfer function that contains information about the size, geometry, and structure of the torus. Here, we describe a new computer model that simulates the reverberation response of a clumpy torus. Given an input optical light curve, the code computes the emission of a 3D ensemble of dust clouds as a function of time at selected IR wavelengths, taking into account light travel delays. We present simulated dust emission responses at 3.6, 4.5, and 30 {\textbackslash}textbackslash mu{\textbackslash}m that explore the effects of various geometrical and structural properties, dust cloud orientation, and anisotropy of the illuminating radiation field. We also briefly explore the effects of cloud shadowing (clouds are shielded from the AGN continuum source). Example synthetic light curves have also been generated, using the observed optical light curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6418 as the input. The torus response is strongly wavelength-dependent, due to the gradient in cloud surface temperature within the torus, and because the cloud emission is strongly anisotropic at shorter wavelengths. Anisotropic illumination of the torus also significantly modifies the torus response, reducing the lag between the IR and optical variations.},

	abstract = {The size and structure of the dusty circumnuclear torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be investigated by analyzing the temporal response of the torus's infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in the AGN ultraviolet/optical luminosity. This method, reverberation mapping, is applicable over a wide redshift range, but the IR response is sensitive to several poorly constrained variables relating to the dust distribution and its illumination, complicating the interpretation of measured reverberation lags. We have used an enhanced version of our torus reverberation mapping code (TORMAC) to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the torus response functions at selected wavelengths, for the standard interstellar medium grain composition. The shapes of the response functions vary widely over the parameter range covered by our models, with the largest variations occurring at shorter wavelengths ({\textbackslash}textbackslash leq 4.5{\textbackslash}textbackslash,{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu{\textbackslash}m). The reverberation lag, quantified as the response-weighted delay (RWD), is most affected by the radial depth of the torus, the steepness of the radial cloud distribution, the degree of anisotropy of the AGN radiation field, and the volume filling factor. Nevertheless, we find that the RWD provides a reasonably robust estimate, to within a factor of {\textbackslash}textbackslash sim 3{\textbackslash}, of the luminosity-weighted torus radius, confirming the basic assumption underlying reverberation mapping. However, overall, the models predict radii at {\textbackslash}2.2{\textbackslash}textbackslash,{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu{\textbackslash}m that are a typically factor of {\textbackslash}textbackslash sim 2{\textbackslash} larger than those derived from K-band reverberation mapping. This is likely an indication that the innermost region of the torus is populated by clouds dominated by large graphite grains.},

Here, we investigate whether such strong polar dust emission is common in AGN. Out of 149 Seyferts in the MIR atlas of local AGN (Asmus et al.), 21 show extended MIR emission on single dish images. In 18 objects, the extended MIR emission aligns with the system axis position angle, established by [OIII], radio, polarisation and maser based position angle measurements. The relative amount of resolved MIR emission is at least 40 per cent and scales with the [OIV] fluxes implying a strong connection between the extended continuum and [OIV] emitters. These results together with the radio-quiet nature of the Seyferts support the scenario that the bulk of MIR emission is emitted by dust in the polar region and not by the torus, which would demand a new paradigm for the infrared emission structure in AGN. The current low detection rate of polar dust in the AGN of the MIR atlas is explained by the lack of sufficient high quality MIR data and the requirement for the orientation, NLR strength and distance of the AGN. The James-Webb Space Telescope will enable much deeper nuclear MIR studies with comparable angular resolution, allowing us to resolve the polar emission and surroundings in most of the nearby AGN.},

We describe also a complementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the AGN host galaxy properties. The active sample appears to have no bias in terms of AGN type, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is two orders of magnitude greater for the Seyfert 2s. In the luminosity range spanned by the sample, log L\_\{14-195keV\} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscured and X-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65\%. The similarity of these fractions to more distant spectroscopic AGN samples, although over a limited luminosity range, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. Our sample confirms that X-ray unabsorbed Seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not more than a few percent of the Seyfert 2 population. At higher luminosities, the optically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dust sublimation radius), but the X-ray absorbed fraction changes little. We argue that the cold X-ray absorption in these Seyfert 1s can be accounted for by neutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (BLR) emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-exists with the BLR and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.},

However, except for a few special cases, the specific inclinations of individual AGNs are unknown. We have developed a promising technique for determining the inclinations of nearby AGNs by mapping the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), which are often easily resolved with Hubble Space Telescope [O iii] imaging and long-slit spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Our studies indicate that NLR kinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflow models that can be used to determine the inclination of the bicone axis, and hence the obscuring torus, with respect to our LOS. We present NLR analysis of 53 Seyfert galaxies and the resulting inclinations from models of 17 individual AGNs with clear signatures of biconical outflows. Our model results agree with the unified model in that Seyfert 1 AGNs have NLRs inclined further toward our LOS than Seyfert 2 AGNs. Knowing the inclinations of these AGN NLRs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow us to determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle. We find no correlation between the inclinations of the AGN NLRs and the disks of their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torus is independent of that of the host disk.},

The K-band coverage of GRAVITY uniquely allows a simultaneous analysis of the size and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR), the size and structure of the near-IR continuum emitting hot dust, and the size of the coronal line region (CLR). We find the BLR probed through broad Br{\textbackslash}textbackslash gamma{\textbackslash} emission is well described by a rotating, thick disk with a radial distribution of clouds peaking in the inner region. In our BLR model the physical mean radius of 16 light days is nearly twice the 10 day time lag that would be measured, which matches very well the 10 day time lag that has been measured by reverberation mapping. We measure a hot dust FWHM size of 0.74 mas (0.14 pc) and further reconstruct an image of the hot dust which reveals a faint (5\% of the total flux) offset cloud which we interpret as an accreting cloud heated by the central AGN. Finally, we directly measure the FWHM size of the nuclear CLR as traced by the [CaVIII] and narrow Br{\textbackslash}textbackslash gamma{\textbackslash} line. We find a FWHM size of 2.2 mas (0.4 pc), fully in line with the expectation of the CLR located between the BLR and narrow line region. Combining all of these measurements together with larger scale near-IR integral field unit and mid-IR interferometry data, we are able to comprehensively map the structure and dynamics of gas and dust from 0.01–100 pc.},

	abstract = {(abridged) It is generally assumed that the distribution of dust on parsec scales forms a geometrically- and optically-thick entity in the equatorial plane around the accretion disk and broad-line region - dubbed "dust torus" - that emits the bulk of the sub-arcsecond-scale IR emission and gives rise to orientation-dependent obscuration. Here we report detailed interferometry observations of the unobscured (type 1) AGN in NGC 3783 that allow us to constrain the size, elongation, and direction of the mid-IR emission with high accuracy. The mid-IR emission is characterized by a strong elongation toward position angle PA -52 deg, closely aligned with the polar axis (PA -45 deg). We determine half-light radii along the major and minor axes at 12.5 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m of (4.23 +/- 0.63) pc x (1.42 +/- 0.21) pc, which corresponds to intrinsically-scaled sizes of (69.4 +/- 10.8) rin x (23.3 +/- 3.5) rin for the inner dust radius of rin = 0.061 pc as inferred from near-IR reverberation mapping. This implies an axis ratio of 3:1, with about 60-90\% of the 8-13 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m emission associated with the polar-elongated component. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation that most of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission in AGN originates from the torus and challenges the justification of using simple torus models to model the broad-band IR emission. It is quite likely that the hot-dust emission in NGC 3783 as recently resolved by near-IR interferometry is misaligned with the mid-IR emitting source, which also finds a correspondence in the two distinct 3-5 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m and 20 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m bumps seen in the high-angular resolution spectral energy distribution (SED). We conclude that these observations support a scenario where the majority of the mid-IR emission in Seyfert AGN originates from a dusty wind in the polar region of the AGN.},

Following our paper I on ground-based mid-IR spectro-photometry (H{\textbackslash}textbackslash "onig et al. 2010), we present an upgrade to our radiative transfer model of 3-dimensional clumpy dust tori. The upgrade with respect to H{\textbackslash}textbackslash "onig et al. (2006) concerns an improved handling of the diffuse radiation field in the torus which is approximated by a statistical approach. The models are presented as tools to translate classical and interferometric observations into characteristic properties of the dust distribution. We compare model SEDs for different chemical and grain-size compositions of the dust and find that clouds with standard ISM dust and optical depth tau\_V{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 50 appear in overall agreement with observed IR SEDs. By studying parameter dependencies, it is shown that type 1 AGN SEDs, in particular the mid-IR spectral index, can be used to constrain the radial dust cloud distribution power-law index 'a', while other parameters are more difficult to assess using SEDs only. Interferometry adds important additional information for modeling when interpreted simultaneously with the SED. Although type 2 AGN can, in principle, be used to constrain model parameters as well, obscuration effects make the analysis more ambiguous. We propose a simple, interferometry-based method to distinguish between "compact” and "extended” radial dust distributions without detailed modeling of the data and introduce a way to easily determine individual or sample average model parameters using the observed optical depth in the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index.},

While current models assume that the IR is emitted from a dusty torus in the equatorial plane of the AGN, spatially resolved observations indicate that the majority of the IR emission from 100 pc in many AGN originates from the polar region, contradicting classical torus models. The new model CAT3D-WIND builds upon the suggestion that the dusty gas around the AGN consists of an inflowing disk and an outflowing wind. Here, it is demonstrated that (1) such disk+wind models cover overall a similar parameter range of observed spectral features in the IR as classical clumpy torus models, e.g. the silicate feature strengths and mid-IR spectral slopes, (2) they reproduce the 3-5\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m bump observed in many type 1 AGN unlike torus models, and (3) they are able to explain polar emission features seen in IR interferometry, even for type 1 AGN at relatively low inclination, as demonstrated for NGC3783. These characteristics make it possible to reconcile radiative transfer models with observations and provide further evidence of a two-component parsec-scaled dusty medium around AGN: the disk gives rise to the 3-5\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash mu\}m near-IR component, while the wind produces the mid-IR emission.

	abstract = {To understand the nature of transient obscuring outflows in active galactic nuclei, we observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 on two occasions in December 2016 triggered by Swift monitoring indicating strong soft X-ray absorption in November. We obtained ultraviolet spectra using COS on HST and optical spectra using FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope that were simultaneous with X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We find new components of broad, blue-shifted absorption associated with Lyα, ıon\{N\}\{v\}, ıon\{Si\}\{iv\}, and ıon\{C\}\{iv\} in our COS spectra. The absorption extends from velocities near zero in the rest-frame of the host galaxy to -6200 {\textbackslash}textbackslash rm km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. These features appear for the first time in NGC 3783 at the same time as the heavy soft X-ray absorption seen in the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The X-ray absorption has a column density of {\textbackslash}textbackslash sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{23\} {\textbackslash}textbackslash rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}, and it partially covers the X-ray continuum source. The X-ray absorption becomes more transparent in the second observation, as does the UV absorption. Combining the X-ray column densities with the UV spectral observations yields an ionization parameter for the obscuring gas of log {\textbackslash}textbackslash xi =1.84{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.2\} {\textbackslash}textbackslash rm erg cm s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. Despite the high intensity of the UV continuum in NGC 3783, F(1470 Å)=8 {\textbackslash}textbackslash times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-14\} {\textbackslash}textbackslash rm erg cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Å{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, the well known narrow UV absorption lines are deeper than in earlier observations in unobscured states, and low ionization species such as ıon\{C\}\{iii\} appear, indicating that the narrow-line gas is more distant from the nucleus and is being shadowed by the gas producing the obscuration. Despite the high continuum flux levels in our observations of NGC 3783, moderate velocities in the UV broad line profiles have substantially diminished. We suggest that a collapse of the broad line region has led to the outburst and triggered the obscuring event.},

The near-IR data are complemented by optical photometry obtained over the same period of time. The light curves in all bands are highly variable and good correlations can be seen between optical and near-IR variations. A cross-correlation analysis for NGC 3783 suggests that some disc near-IR emission is present in the J-band flux, while the H and K bands are dominated by emission from a torus located at the dust sublimation radius. For MR 2251−178 the cross-correlation analysis and the optical–near-IR flux–flux plots suggest that the near-IR flux is dominated by disc emission. We model the optical to near-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of both sources and find that disc flaring might be a necessary modification to the geometry of a thin disc in order to explain the observations. The SED of MR 2251−178 gives some indications of the presence of near-IR emission from a torus. Finally, we consider the implications of the standard α-disc model to explain the different origin of the variable near-IR emission in these AGN.},

	abstract = {Despite the hypothesized similar face-on viewing angles, the infrared emission of type-1 AGNs has diverse spectral energy distribution (SED) shapes that deviate substantially from the well-characterized quasar templates. Motivated by the commonly-seen UV-optical obscuration and the discovery of parsec-scale mid-IR polar dust emission in some nearby AGNs, we develop semi-empirical SED libraries for reddened type-1 AGNs built on the quasar intrinsic templates, assuming low-level extinction caused by an extended distribution of large dust grains. We demonstrate that this model can reproduce the nuclear UV-to-IR SED and the strong mid-IR polar dust emission of NGC 3783, the type-1 AGN with the most relevant and robust observational constraints. In addition, we compile 64 low-{\textbackslash}z{\textbackslash} Seyfert-1 nuclei with negligible mid-IR star formation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual IR SEDs as well as the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs. Given the success of these fits, we characterize the possible infrared SED of AGN polar dust emission and utilize a simple but effective strategy to infer its prevalence among type-1 AGNs. The SEDs of high-{\textbackslash}z{\textbackslash} peculiar AGNs, including the extremely red quasars, mid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced by our model. These results indicate that the IR SEDs of most AGNs, regardless of redshift or luminosity, arise from similar circumnuclear torus properties but differ mainly due to the optical depths of extended obscuring dust components.},

	abstract = {As part of an extensive study of the physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) we report high spatial resolution near-IR integral-field spectroscopy of the narrow-line region (NLR) and coronal-line region (CLR) of seven Seyfert galaxies. These measurements elucidate for the first time the two-dimensional spatial distribution and kinematics of the recombination line Brγ and high-ionization lines [Si vi], [Al ix], and [Ca viii] on scales {\textless}300 pc from the AGN. The observations reveal kinematic signatures of rotation and outflow in the NLR and CLR. The spatially resolved kinematics can be modeled as a combination of an outflow bicone and a rotating disk coincident with the molecular gas. High-excitation emission is seen in both components, suggesting it is leaking out of a clumpy torus. While NGC 1068 (Seyfert 2) is viewed nearly edge-on, intermediate-type Seyferts are viewed at intermediate angles, consistent with unified schemes. A correlation between the outflow velocity and the molecular gas mass in r {\textless} 30 pc indicates that the accumulation of gas around the AGN increases the collimation and velocity of the outflow. The outflow rate is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the accretion rate, implying that the outflow is mass loaded by the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In half of the observed AGNs, the kinetic power of the outflow is of the order of the power required by two-stage feedback models to be thermally coupled to the ISM and to match the MBH–σ* relation. In these objects, the radio jet is clearly interacting with the ISM, indicative of a link between jet power and outflow power.},

	abstract = {The obscuring circumnuclear torus of dusty molecular gas is one of the major components of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The torus can be studied by analyzing the time response of its infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in the AGN continuum luminosity, a technique known as reverberation mapping. The IR response is the convolution of the AGN ultraviolet/optical light curve with a transfer function that contains information about the size, geometry, and structure of the torus. Here, we describe a new computer model that simulates the reverberation response of a clumpy torus. Given an input optical light curve, the code computes the emission of a 3D ensemble of dust clouds as a function of time at selected IR wavelengths, taking into account light travel delays. We present simulated dust emission responses at 3.6, 4.5, and 30 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m that explore the effects of various geometrical and structural properties, dust cloud orientation, and anisotropy of the illuminating radiation field. We also briefly explore the effects of cloud shadowing (clouds are shielded from the AGN continuum source). Example synthetic light curves have also been generated, using the observed optical light curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6418 as the input. The torus response is strongly wavelength-dependent, due to the gradient in cloud surface temperature within the torus, and because the cloud emission is strongly anisotropic at shorter wavelengths. Anisotropic illumination of the torus also significantly modifies the torus response, reducing the lag between the IR and optical variations.},

This method, reverberation mapping, is applicable over a wide redshift range, but the IR response is sensitive to several poorly constrained variables relating to the dust distribution and its illumination, complicating the interpretation of measured reverberation lags. We have used an enhanced version of our torus reverberation mapping code (TORMAC) to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the torus response functions at selected wavelengths, for the standard interstellar medium grain composition. The shapes of the response functions vary widely over the parameter range covered by our models, with the largest variations occurring at shorter wavelengths (\${\textbackslash}leq 4.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$m). The reverberation lag, quantified as the response-weighted delay (RWD), is most affected by the radial depth of the torus, the steepness of the radial cloud distribution, the degree of anisotropy of the AGN radiation field, and the volume filling factor. Nevertheless, we find that the RWD provides a reasonably robust estimate, to within a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$, of the luminosity-weighted torus radius, confirming the basic assumption underlying reverberation mapping. However, overall, the models predict radii at \$2.2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$m that are a typically factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ larger than those derived from K-band reverberation mapping. This is likely an indication that the innermost region of the torus is populated by clouds dominated by large graphite grains.},

The more compact He II-emitting region, on the other hand, appears to be dominated by outflowing orbits. The black hole mass is constrained to be M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}=2.82{\textasciicircum}\{+1.55\}\_\{-0.63\}{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_\{ødot\}, which is consistent with the simple reverberation constraint on the mass based on a mean time delay, line width, and scale factor of {\textbackslash}langle f {\textbackslash}rangle=4.82. The difference in kinematics between the Hβ- and He II-emitting regions of the BLR is intriguing given the recent history of large changes in the ionizing luminosity of NGC 3783 and evidence for possible changes in the BLR structure as a result.},

	abstract = {Recent mid-infrared (MIR) interferometric observations showed in few active galactic nuclei (AGN) that the bulk of the infrared emission originates from the polar region above the putative torus, where only little dust should be present. Here, we investigate whether such strong polar dust emission is common in AGN. Out of 149 Seyferts in the MIR atlas of local AGN (Asmus et al.), 21 show extended MIR emission on single dish images. In 18 objects, the extended MIR emission aligns with the system axis position angle, established by [OIII], radio, polarisation and maser based position angle measurements. The relative amount of resolved MIR emission is at least 40 per cent and scales with the [OIV] fluxes implying a strong connection between the extended continuum and [OIV] emitters. These results together with the radio-quiet nature of the Seyferts support the scenario that the bulk of MIR emission is emitted by dust in the polar region and not by the torus, which would demand a new paradigm for the infrared emission structure in AGN. The current low detection rate of polar dust in the AGN of the MIR atlas is explained by the lack of sufficient high quality MIR data and the requirement for the orientation, NLR strength and distance of the AGN. The James-Webb Space Telescope will enable much deeper nuclear MIR studies with comparable angular resolution, allowing us to resolve the polar emission and surroundings in most of the nearby AGN.},

We obtained ultraviolet spectra using COS on HST and optical spectra using FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope that were simultaneous with X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We find new components of broad, blue-shifted absorption associated with Lyα, ıon\{N\}\{v\}, ıon\{Si\}\{iv\}, and ıon\{C\}\{iv\} in our COS spectra. The absorption extends from velocities near zero in the rest-frame of the host galaxy to -6200 {\textbackslash}rm km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. These features appear for the first time in NGC 3783 at the same time as the heavy soft X-ray absorption seen in the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The X-ray absorption has a column density of {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{23\} {\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}, and it partially covers the X-ray continuum source. The X-ray absorption becomes more transparent in the second observation, as does the UV absorption. Combining the X-ray column densities with the UV spectral observations yields an ionization parameter for the obscuring gas of log {\textbackslash}xi =1.84{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.2\} {\textbackslash}rm erg cm s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}.

Despite the high continuum flux levels in our observations of NGC 3783, moderate velocities in the UV broad line profiles have substantially diminished. We suggest that a collapse of the broad line region has led to the outburst and triggered the obscuring event.},

	abstract = {(abridged) It is generally assumed that the distribution of dust on parsec scales forms a geometrically- and optically-thick entity in the equatorial plane around the accretion disk and broad-line region - dubbed "dust torus" - that emits the bulk of the sub-arcsecond-scale IR emission and gives rise to orientation-dependent obscuration. Here we report detailed interferometry observations of the unobscured (type 1) AGN in NGC 3783 that allow us to constrain the size, elongation, and direction of the mid-IR emission with high accuracy. The mid-IR emission is characterized by a strong elongation toward position angle PA -52 deg, closely aligned with the polar axis (PA -45 deg). We determine half-light radii along the major and minor axes at 12.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m of (4.23 +/- 0.63) pc x (1.42 +/- 0.21) pc, which corresponds to intrinsically-scaled sizes of (69.4 +/- 10.8) rin x (23.3 +/- 3.5) rin for the inner dust radius of rin = 0.061 pc as inferred from near-IR reverberation mapping. This implies an axis ratio of 3:1, with about 60-90\% of the 8-13 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m emission associated with the polar-elongated component. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation that most of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission in AGN originates from the torus and challenges the justification of using simple torus models to model the broad-band IR emission. It is quite likely that the hot-dust emission in NGC 3783 as recently resolved by near-IR interferometry is misaligned with the mid-IR emitting source, which also finds a correspondence in the two distinct 3-5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m and 20 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m bumps seen in the high-angular resolution spectral energy distribution (SED). We conclude that these observations support a scenario where the majority of the mid-IR emission in Seyfert AGN originates from a dusty wind in the polar region of the AGN.},

	abstract = {This letter presents a revised radiative transfer model for the infrared (IR) emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN). While current models assume that the IR is emitted from a dusty torus in the equatorial plane of the AGN, spatially resolved observations indicate that the majority of the IR emission from 100 pc in many AGN originates from the polar region, contradicting classical torus models. The new model CAT3D-WIND builds upon the suggestion that the dusty gas around the AGN consists of an inflowing disk and an outflowing wind. Here, it is demonstrated that (1) such disk+wind models cover overall a similar parameter range of observed spectral features in the IR as classical clumpy torus models, e.g. the silicate feature strengths and mid-IR spectral slopes, (2) they reproduce the 3-5\{{\textbackslash}mu\}m bump observed in many type 1 AGN unlike torus models, and (3) they are able to explain polar emission features seen in IR interferometry, even for type 1 AGN at relatively low inclination, as demonstrated for NGC3783. These characteristics make it possible to reconcile radiative transfer models with observations and provide further evidence of a two-component parsec-scaled dusty medium around AGN: the disk gives rise to the 3-5\{{\textbackslash}mu\}m near-IR component, while the wind produces the mid-IR emission. The model SEDs will be made available for download.},

However, except for a few special cases, the specific inclinations of individual AGNs are unknown. We have developed a promising technique for determining the inclinations of nearby AGNs by mapping the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), which are often easily resolved with Hubble Space Telescope [O iii] imaging and long-slit spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Our studies indicate that NLR kinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflow models that can be used to determine the inclination of the bicone axis, and hence the obscuring torus, with respect to our LOS. We present NLR analysis of 53 Seyfert galaxies and the resulting inclinations from models of 17 individual AGNs with clear signatures of biconical outflows. Our model results agree with the unified model in that Seyfert 1 AGNs have NLRs inclined further toward our LOS than Seyfert 2 AGNs. Knowing the inclinations of these AGN NLRs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow us to determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle. We find no correlation between the inclinations of the AGN NLRs and the disks of their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torus is independent of that of the host disk.},

These measurements elucidate for the first time the two-dimensional spatial distribution and kinematics of the recombination line Brγ and high-ionization lines [Si vi], [Al ix], and [Ca viii] on scales {\textless}300 pc from the AGN. The observations reveal kinematic signatures of rotation and outflow in the NLR and CLR. The spatially resolved kinematics can be modeled as a combination of an outflow bicone and a rotating disk coincident with the molecular gas. High-excitation emission is seen in both components, suggesting it is leaking out of a clumpy torus. While NGC 1068 (Seyfert 2) is viewed nearly edge-on, intermediate-type Seyferts are viewed at intermediate angles, consistent with unified schemes. A correlation between the outflow velocity and the molecular gas mass in r {\textless} 30 pc indicates that the accumulation of gas around the AGN increases the collimation and velocity of the outflow. The outflow rate is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the accretion rate, implying that the outflow is mass loaded by the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In half of the observed AGNs, the kinetic power of the outflow is of the order of the power required by two-stage feedback models to be thermally coupled to the ISM and to match the MBH–σ* relation. In these objects, the radio jet is clearly interacting with the ISM, indicative of a link between jet power and outflow power.},

The K-band coverage of GRAVITY uniquely allows a simultaneous analysis of the size and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR), the size and structure of the near-IR continuum emitting hot dust, and the size of the coronal line region (CLR). We find the BLR probed through broad Br\${\textbackslash}gamma\$ emission is well described by a rotating, thick disk with a radial distribution of clouds peaking in the inner region. In our BLR model the physical mean radius of 16 light days is nearly twice the 10 day time lag that would be measured, which matches very well the 10 day time lag that has been measured by reverberation mapping. We measure a hot dust FWHM size of 0.74 mas (0.14 pc) and further reconstruct an image of the hot dust which reveals a faint (5\% of the total flux) offset cloud which we interpret as an accreting cloud heated by the central AGN. Finally, we directly measure the FWHM size of the nuclear CLR as traced by the [CaVIII] and narrow Br\${\textbackslash}gamma\$ line. We find a FWHM size of 2.2 mas (0.4 pc), fully in line with the expectation of the CLR located between the BLR and narrow line region. Combining all of these measurements together with larger scale near-IR integral field unit and mid-IR interferometry data, we are able to comprehensively map the structure and dynamics of gas and dust from 0.01--100 pc.},

	abstract = {The dusty environments (= "dust tori'') of AGN are now in reach of observations. Following our paper I on ground-based mid-IR spectro-photometry (H{\textbackslash}"onig et al. 2010), we present an upgrade to our radiative transfer model of 3-dimensional clumpy dust tori. The upgrade with respect to H{\textbackslash}"onig et al. (2006) concerns an improved handling of the diffuse radiation field in the torus which is approximated by a statistical approach. The models are presented as tools to translate classical and interferometric observations into characteristic properties of the dust distribution. We compare model SEDs for different chemical and grain-size compositions of the dust and find that clouds with standard ISM dust and optical depth tau\_V{\textasciitilde}50 appear in overall agreement with observed IR SEDs. By studying parameter dependencies, it is shown that type 1 AGN SEDs, in particular the mid-IR spectral index, can be used to constrain the radial dust cloud distribution power-law index 'a', while other parameters are more difficult to assess using SEDs only. Interferometry adds important additional information for modeling when interpreted simultaneously with the SED. Although type 2 AGN can, in principle, be used to constrain model parameters as well, obscuration effects make the analysis more ambiguous. We propose a simple, interferometry-based method to distinguish between "compact'' and "extended'' radial dust distributions without detailed modeling of the data and introduce a way to easily determine individual or sample average model parameters using the observed optical depth in the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index.},

	abstract = {Despite the hypothesized similar face-on viewing angles, the infrared emission of type-1 AGNs has diverse spectral energy distribution (SED) shapes that deviate substantially from the well-characterized quasar templates. Motivated by the commonly-seen UV-optical obscuration and the discovery of parsec-scale mid-IR polar dust emission in some nearby AGNs, we develop semi-empirical SED libraries for reddened type-1 AGNs built on the quasar intrinsic templates, assuming low-level extinction caused by an extended distribution of large dust grains. We demonstrate that this model can reproduce the nuclear UV-to-IR SED and the strong mid-IR polar dust emission of NGC 3783, the type-1 AGN with the most relevant and robust observational constraints. In addition, we compile 64 low-\$z\$ Seyfert-1 nuclei with negligible mid-IR star formation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual IR SEDs as well as the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs. Given the success of these fits, we characterize the possible infrared SED of AGN polar dust emission and utilize a simple but effective strategy to infer its prevalence among type-1 AGNs. The SEDs of high-\$z\$ peculiar AGNs, including the extremely red quasars, mid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced by our model. These results indicate that the IR SEDs of most AGNs, regardless of redshift or luminosity, arise from similar circumnuclear torus properties but differ mainly due to the optical depths of extended obscuring dust components.},

	abstract = {We describe a complete volume limited sample of nearby active galaxies selected by their 14-195keV luminosity, and outline its rationale for studying the mechanisms regulating gas inflow and outflow. We describe also a complementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the AGN host galaxy properties. The active sample appears to have no bias in terms of AGN type, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is two orders of magnitude greater for the Seyfert 2s. In the luminosity range spanned by the sample, log L\_\{14-195keV\} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscured and X-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65\%. The similarity of these fractions to more distant spectroscopic AGN samples, although over a limited luminosity range, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. Our sample confirms that X-ray unabsorbed Seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not more than a few percent of the Seyfert 2 population. At higher luminosities, the optically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dust sublimation radius), but the X-ray absorbed fraction changes little. We argue that the cold X-ray absorption in these Seyfert 1s can be accounted for by neutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (BLR) emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-exists with the BLR and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.},
