# Project Abstract
When supermassive black holes, found in the center of most galaxies, rapidly consume material, they are known as active galactic
nuclei (AGN). This study employs computational modeling to explore the dust structure commonly found around AGN, focusing
on one such AGN, NGC 3783. Utilizing the TORMAC code developed by Dr. Triana Almeyda, we generate simulated infrared
(IR) light curves based on a 3D ensemble of clouds within a simulated dust structure, using observed optical light curves of
NGC 3783 as the input continuum source. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code, written by collaborator Dr. Jack
Gallimore, to determine the best-fit parameters of the dust distribution by comparing the simulated IR light curves to the observed
IR light curves for NGC 3783. Here we present preliminary results from these simulations and demonstrate their application
towards constraining the structure and geometry of NGC 3783.
